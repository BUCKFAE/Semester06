## KDD
Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is the process of (semi-) automatic 
extraction of knowledge from databases, which is
- valid (in statistical sense)
- unknown so far (not general knowledge)
- potentially usefull (for a given application)
- understatable

## Data Mining
1. Synonym for KDD
1. Datamining is a **step in the KDD proces**

## Big Data
- Volume, Veloccity, Variety

Big data is high volume, high velocity and or 
high variety information assets that require new forms of 
processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight
discovery and prcoess optimazion

## Data Science
Field of scientific methods, processes, algos and systems to 
extract knowledge or insights form data in various forms, either
structured or unstructured, similar to data mining

## Features
feature = attribute = variable

Can be
- Numeric
- Oridnal (ordered)
- Categorical / nominal (e.g. red, yellow, green, blue)

## OLTP vs OLAP
OLTP (Online Transactio Processing): Daily buisness
OLAP: Online Analytical Processing: Uses data warehouse

### OLAP Operations
Drill-down / Roll up: (Zoom in / Zoom out)
- Visualization of different aggregation levels

Slice & Dice:
- Reduce dimensionality of the visualzed data
- Only use drilled-down version of the data
- Always reduces dimension
