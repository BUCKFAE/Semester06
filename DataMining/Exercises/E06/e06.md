# Aufgabe 1
## Aufgabe 1.1

1st Step: Sort items in descending order of frequency <br>
2nd Step: Insert transactions successively into the tree 

## Aufgabe 1.2
Most frequent items are closer to the top of the tree, count 
variable tells how often an item is used.

## Aufgabe 1.3
- Consisness
    - Shorter rules are better (fewer items)
- Generality
    - More general rules are better (more cases covered)
- Reliability
    - High confidence / accuracy is better
- Diversity
    - Rules should be dissimilar to each other
- Novelty
    - Previously unknown, not derivable from other rules
- Surprisingness / unexpectedness
    - Good rules contradict previous knowledge / expectations
- Applicability
    - Can be implemented (in the application)

Siehe iPad

## Aufagbe 2.2
Only take the part of the tree, that later ends in a C, the new tree refers only to transactions that also contain C

# Aufgabe 3
## Aufgabe 3.1
Table page 48

## Aufgabe 3.2
Support: Proportion of transactions in D that contain X <br>
Confidence: conf(x->y) support(x and y) / support(x)
- conf(diabers, chips -> beer) = 80% means:
    - 80% of all customers who bought diapers and chips also bought beer

High number means: Few cases, but very high confidence for these cases.
